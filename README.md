# Deterministic Multi-Step Reasoning Engine

This repo defines the scope and planning for a deterministic, testable
multi-step reasoning engine / SDK. It is intentionally non-conversational and
designed to be embedded in other systems.

## What This Is

- A deterministic reasoning engine with structured, validated steps
- Fully traceable and replayable execution with strict schemas
- A programmatic API (not a chatbot or UI)

## What This Is Not

- A chat UI or conversational agent
- Free-form text generation without validation
- LLM-controlled execution flow

## Status

Current phase: Planning & Design
